SNuGGY (Simulation of the Neutrino and Gamma Galactic Yield)
===========================================================

Run The IPython Notebook to test the code.
Detailed instructions coming soon.... As soon as I get some extra time.
For Ipython notebook, if you get an error for 3d plot, there is somthing wrong with matplotlib. To avoid it you can just comment out the plot_dir=.. field.

Note:
Please contact Abhishek Desai at desai@wisc.edu before using the code.
Thank you.
